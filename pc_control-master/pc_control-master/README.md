monitoring keyboard and mouse movement , control mouse and keyboard from python or arduino(over serial) 

ok so i'm using the python mouse module https://pypi.org/project/mouse/  to monitor and control the mouse
and keyboard module https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/ to monitor and control keyboard
and if you wanted to use arduino to control your mouse/keyboard you should install pyserial  https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/
